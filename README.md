# Train-game

This script aims to solve the classic 'Train game' for Sydney trains. A typical Sydney train will have a specific 4-digit number for each carriage on the train. The aim of the game is to try to manipulate the numbers in order to get the result of 10 eg. (5554 = (5+5)X(5-4) = 10). This script trials every possible combination of operations to see what formulas can be created to make 10.

Hope you enjoy!
